Core principles & constraints

Clean, minimal, readable: Let whitespace breathe. Use fewer but stronger images / videos rather than a barrage of them.

Responsive-first (mobile / tablet / desktop): Design from small screens upward.

Performance-conscious: Lazy-load images & videos, optimize media (compress, WebP, etc).

Clear navigation & structure: Logical menu, section segmentation, breadcrumbing if needed.

Strong CTAs & conversion flow: E.g., “Book Appointment,” “Contact,” “Emergency,” etc.

SEO-friendly: Each major service should have its own route (URL) so search engines can index them.

Accessibility: Contrast, alt texts, legible fonts, keyboard nav, etc.

Brand consistency / visual identity: Use a consistent color palette, typography, iconography.

Suggested high-level site structure

Rather than a single “scroll” page, consider a hybrid: a landing / home page + sub-pages. Something like:

Home / Landing page

Hero section (strong image or video background, overlay with headline + CTA “Book Appointment”)

Short intro / mission

Quick links or “Our Services” teasers

Maybe a small gallery or featured images

Testimonials / trust signals (e.g. client reviews, associations)

Contact / footer summary

About / Nosaltres

Clinic history, mission, values

Team / staff with photos & bios

Facilities & infrastructure (images, lab, equipment)

Services (or multiple sub-pages under a services section)

Each major service (e.g. Radiologia, Oncologia, Ecografía, Cirugía, Laboratorio, etc.) has its own page or at least a well-structured section.

For each: what it is, why it matters, process, machinery, FAQs, etc.

Intersperse related visuals (photos, infographics)

Videos / Media / Gallery

A dedicated gallery / media page (with images and videos) rather than embedding background videos everywhere.

Use thumbnails or a lightbox for videos; don’t autoplay behind text everywhere.

Contact / Location / Hours

Map embed (Google Maps or similar)

Address, phone, email, opening schedule

Contact form (simple, validated)

Emergency / urgent contact (if applicable)

Blog / News / Resources (optional but useful)

Articles about pet health, preventative care, tips

Helps SEO, draws returning visitors

Booking / Appointment / Cita Prèvia

A page or modal / integration (or link out) for clients to request or schedule appointments (if you have a booking system).

If not full booking, at least a “Request Appointment” form.

Footer (global)

Quick links to major pages

Social media links

Address and contact summary

Legal links (privacy, terms)

Maybe a mini-sitemap

You can still include a “scrollable” layout on the home page with anchored sections, but don’t force all content into one scroll page.

Design / visual & UX recommendations

Here’s what to watch out for / incorporate:

Header / Navigation

Use a “sticky but minimal” header: maybe slim when scrolled, or hide on scroll-down and show on scroll-up.

Avoid letting header cover too much vertical space.

Use anchor links on the home page but also have full navigation for subpages.

On mobile: collapsible hamburger menu with clear labeling.

Hero section

Use one strong image or short muted video + overlay with an attention-grabbing headline (“Clínica Veterinària Can Pilé – Medicina Avançada per a mascotes”) + primary CTA (“Demana cita”, “Contacta”, etc.)

Be careful with contrast: if video is behind text, overlay a semi-transparent dark layer to ensure readability.

Content hierarchy & typography

Use heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) properly.

Use readable fonts (sans-serif, sizes adapt for mobile).

Keep paragraphs short; use bulleted lists, icons where appropriate.

Use visual separators (colored bands, alternating backgrounds, etc.) to delineate sections.

Images & videos

Curate a selection of high-quality images; avoid too many duplicates or filler.

Use lazy loading (load images/videos only when in viewport).

Use image formats like WebP or compressed JPG.

For videos: use a poster frame and only auto-play where appropriate (or none). Maybe allow user control.

Avoid text over busy image backgrounds; if you must, darken/lighten the image or add translucent overlay.

CTAs & interactive elements

Every page should have a CTA to contact / request appointment.

Use buttons rather than text links.

On hover / focus states, add subtle animations (scale, shadow, color change).

Use indicator of active section (if anchored) in the nav (highlight which section you’re on).

Performance & loading

Minimize initial payload: only load what’s needed immediately.

Use “defer” or “async” for JS.

Compress CSS / bundle / tree-shake.

Use caching / CDN for static assets.

Consider alternate versions (mobile images) to reduce bandwidth.

SEO & routing

Give each service a distinct URL (/servicios/radiologia, /servicios/oncolgia, etc.).

Use meta tags, alt texts for images, structured data (e.g. LocalBusiness, Veterinarian) where possible.

Use proper <title>, <description>, OpenGraph tags, etc.

Use internal links (e.g. from service pages link to related ones).

Accessibility

Ensure color contrast meets standards (WCAG).

Alt text for images

Keyboard navigable menu

Proper form labeling

Responsive / scalable font sizes
